# Sanitation-Tracker-Companion-App

This is a companion data-presentation app I created for a performance-tracking hand-sanitation system! This system is designed for use in high-risk team environments like hospitals and restaurants.

Upon launch, the app downloads live data from the database and displays it on screen. We can then search for all the entries for specific IDs. This will display all recorded handwash events, their duration, and a calculated overall compliance rating for that ID. The Read Data button can be used to update local data by pulling from the database (for this, the database was simply Excel Online!).

A colleage of mine made this incredible demo for the whole project!
